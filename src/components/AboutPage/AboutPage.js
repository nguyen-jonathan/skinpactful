              Welcome to the first step to clear and healthy looking skin! My
              name is Thomas (32 years old) and I have been battling with adult
              acne for nearly 10 years. I would be insecure about going out in
              public and constantly looking in a mirror throughout the day,
              hoping it would magically get better. After a while I got tired of
              this insecurity of mine and decided to dedicate myself to curing
              this disorder.
            </p>
            <p className="aboutPage-primary-text">
              I have researched and tested dozens of products, spoke with
              skincare professionals, altered my diet, literally everything you
              can think of. SPOILER ALERT, I ended up cracking the code to
              winning this war against this annoying splinter in my life. Now my
              friends, family and even strangers would approach me complimenting
              me on my skin, which I couldnâ€™t believe!

              sharing my knowledge and experience. Saving you the trouble of
              years of fighting acne, damaging your skin and wasting money on
              skin care products that aren't helping you. Everyone is different
              and I believe listening to each other's story and having a real
